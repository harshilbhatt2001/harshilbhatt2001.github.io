Hello, I am Harshil Bhatt, a third year undergrad pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering at MIT, Manipal.

My research interests lie in the field of wireless sensor networks, multi-agent systems, wireless power transfer and real-time systems. 
I am a strong advocate of energy-efficient algorithms, and do whatever I can to squeeze maximum performance from the last Watt.

I am open to new projects and collaborations. If you have a potential project, feel free to drop a mail. Check out my past and current projects in my [CV](http://harshilbhatt2001.github.io/files/Harshil_Bhatt_Resume.pdf)
